## Simscape-based Momentum Wheel Controlled Pendulum Simulation System

This is a simulation system for controlling a pendulum using momentum wheels based on Simscape. It simulates the connection of a motor (input PWM) to the momentum wheel, altering the motion of the pendulum.

It includes the following features:

- Oscillatory response of the pendulum
- Non-oscillatory response of the pendulum
- Inverted pendulum control
- Adjustable PID mode
- Introduction of step disturbance

The model contains a complete motor and pendulum model for further development. The pendulum and motor have been encapsulated as sub-functions for portability.

## Dependencies

Version Information: This model was built using Matlab R2022A. It is recommended that your version is not lower than this for optimal performance.

To run this model, you will need at least the following Toolboxes:

- Simscape, Simscape Multibody, Simscape Electrical

For further development of PID parameters, I also recommend using the following Toolboxes:

- System Identification
- Simulink Control Design

## Quick Start

Click the "Run" button above Simulink, and wait for the rendering to start.

The mode selection section is below, click the knob to highlight it, and then you can make adjustments.
